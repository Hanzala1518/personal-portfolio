> **Threat Intel Briefing:** Credential stuffing is noisy. MFA fatigue is patient, automated, and devastating when left unchecked.

## Kill Chain Recap

1. Compromised credentials sourced from dark web dumps.
2. Automated MFA push flood leveraging residential proxies.
3. Exhausted employee approves login after 30+ prompts.
4. Session hijacked for internal recon and data exfil.

## Detection Strategy

- Correlate **push frequency** across identity providers.
- Flag **geo-anomalous** push notifications.
- Apply **risk scoring** to repeated denials with identical device fingerprints.

```sql
-- Supabase Edge SQL to aggregate abnormal MFA pushes
select
  user_id,
  count(*) filter (where status = 'denied') as denied_count,
  count(*) filter (where status = 'approved') as approved_count,
  max(timestamp) as last_seen
from auth.mfa_events
where timestamp > now() - interval '2 hours'
group by 1
having count(*) > 20 and approved_count > 0;
```

## Response Playbook

- Enforce **number matching** on Azure AD within 24 hours.
- Deploy **conditional access** blocking high-risk IP ranges.
- Automate **password reset + token revocation** sequence via Edge Functions.

Stay ahead of adversaries by blending identity telemetry with behavioral analytics. Future deep dive: constructing adversarial simulations to train analysts against fatigue attacks.
