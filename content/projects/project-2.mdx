## Overview

Phishing Intel Matrix operationalizes large-scale URL intelligence with an ONNX-optimized model, browser-side inference fallback, and automated abuse desk escalation workflows.

## The Problem

- Phishing detection often lags attacker campaigns by hours.
- Manual takedown requests slow remediation.
- Analysts lack granular feature visibility explaining classification results.

## Hypothesis

Automating the full lifecycle—from detection to escalation—while providing interpretable model outputs will significantly reduce time-to-takedown and analyst overhead.

## Architecture

- **Collection:** Cloudflare Workers stream suspicious URLs into Supabase.
- **Inference:** Primary inference served through FastAPI + ONNX Runtime with Vercel Edge fallback via TensorFlow.js.
- **Response:** Resend API delivers templated takedown emails with signed PGP attachments.

## Implementation Highlights

- Deployed feature hashing pipeline in Rust to keep payloads under 50KB for edge distribution.
- Integrated DOMPurify and CSP hardening to neutralize malicious preview payloads.
- Built a live status map overlay using Mapbox GL to visualize attack origination points.

## Results

- **98.2%** accuracy with **0.4%** false positives on latest PhishTank validation set.
- Automated escalation reduced takedown initiation to under **4 minutes**.
- Enabled analyst explainability with SHAP visualizations surfaced in the case study viewer.

## Retrospective

- Introduce active learning to auto-curate ambiguous samples.
- Expand coverage into IDN homograph detection using font rendering heuristics.
